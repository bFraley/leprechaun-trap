        <p><strong>THE LEPRECHAUN (BY ROBERT DWYER JOYCE 1830 - 1883)</strong></p>
                <p>In a shady nook one moonlit night,
                A leprechaun I spied 
                In scarlet coat and cap of green,
                A cruiskeen by his side.
                'Twas tick, tack, tick, his hammer went,
                Upon a weeny shoe,
                And I laughed to think of a purse of gold,
                But the fairy was laughing too.</p>

                <p>With tip-toe step and beating heart,
                Quite softly I drew night.
                There was mischief in his merry face,
                A twinkle in his eye;
                He hammered and sang with tiny voice,
                And sipped the mountain dew;
                Oh! I laughed to think he was caught at last,
                But the fairy was laughing, too.</p>

                <p>As quick as thought I grasped the elf,
                "Your fairy purse," I cried,
                "My purse?" said he, "'tis in her hand,
                That lady by your side."
                I turned to look, the elf was off,
                And what was I to do?
                Oh! I laughed to think what a fool I'd been,
                And, the fairy was laughing too.</p>
