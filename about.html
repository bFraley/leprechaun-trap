            <h2>THE LEPRECHAUN (BY ROBERT DWYER JOYCE 1830 - 1883)</h2>
                <p>In a shady nook one moonlit night,<br>
                A leprechaun I spied<br>
                In scarlet coat and cap of green,<br>
                A cruiskeen by his side.<br>
                'Twas tick, tack, tick, his hammer went,<br>
                Upon a weeny shoe,<br>
                And I laughed to think of a purse of gold,<br>
                But the fairy was laughing too.</p>

                <p>With tip-toe step and beating heart,<br>
                Quite softly I drew night.<br>
                There was mischief in his merry face,<br>
                A twinkle in his eye;<br>
                He hammered and sang with tiny voice,<br>
                And sipped the mountain dew;<br>
                Oh! I laughed to think he was caught at last,<br>
                But the fairy was laughing, too.</p>

                <p>As quick as thought I grasped the elf,<br>
                "Your fairy purse," I cried,<br>
                "My purse?" said he, "'tis in her hand,<br>
                That lady by your side."<br>
                I turned to look, the elf was off,<br>
                And what was I to do?<br>
                Oh! I laughed to think what a fool I'd been,<br>
                And, the fairy was laughing too.</p>
